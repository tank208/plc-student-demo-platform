# DEVLOG – Week 3, Day 2

**Date:** May 21, 2025  
**Time Logged:** 7.5 hours  
**Location:** UI CDA Robotics Lab

## Focus

- Curriculum structure and safety planning
- Pre-implementation design of Module 01
- Documentation for reproducibility and clarity

## Actions Completed

- Scaffolded curriculum folders for Modules 00–05
- Created separate tracks for student and instructor material
- Parsed Arduino Opta user manual to extract verified runtime behavior and I/O mappings
- Developed internal-only logic diagram for LED control
- Built early runtime notes and wiring risk mitigation documentation
- Prepared and configured Arduino PLC IDE
- Mapped GPIOs (PC13 → BTN_USER, PA5 → LED_BUILTIN) for Ladder logic programming

## Observations

- Mechanical housing not beginner-friendly
- Official diagrams are overly complex for introductory use
- IDE behavior and bootloader documentation lacks clarity

## Planning Summary

Module 01 is ready for implementation with IDE setup complete and Opta recognized via USB. Programming and live testing will be completed during the next session.
