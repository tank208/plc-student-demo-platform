# DEVLOG – Week 12, Day 4

**Date:** 2025-07-25  
**Location:** Home PLC Lab  
**Time Logged:** 6.5 hours  
**System:** VS Code, Arduino PLC IDE, GitHub  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Commit ID:** _(pending final push)_

---

## Task Summary

**Planned:**

- Cut final wires for Module 02 and photograph finished layout  
- Document wiring log and asset reference in repo  
- Begin file polish for module documentation pages  
- Research image/media strategy for instruction-level clarity  

**Actual:**

- Created and finalized wiring log for Module 02 with cut lengths  
- Confirmed Arduino-recommended 17 AWG is functionally replaceable with 18 AWG in U.S. use case  
- Outlined visual standard for wiring photos (angle, lighting, naming)  
- Developed wiring documentation format to apply across all modules  
- Reviewed repo structure for media integration and instructional clarity  
- Only one checkbox completed, but considerable progress made toward visual + instructional system coherence  

---

## System / Build Updates

- Wiring log finalized for Module 02 with cut lengths and signal map  
- `/03_assets/` photo planning finalized for future photography  
- Reference diagram and photo filenames planned for visual pairing  
- Standards created for:  
  - Wire photo composition  
  - File naming for assets  
  - Folder reference consistency

---

## Diagnostics and Testing

- Confirmed no change in logic from yesterday’s `.st` files  
- Wiring documentation prepared against actual physical hardware setup  
- Verified correct usage of stranded 18 AWG ferrule wire for PLC terminal blocks

---

## Key Findings and Learnings

- A clean wiring harness is part of systems integrity — document it like logic  
- Visual documentation carries teaching weight and should follow a standard  
- Ferrule terminations and photo clarity are key for future curriculum use  
- Cutting and building clean wires is not extra work — it defines baseline for replicability  

---

## Issues and Fixes

**Issue:** Arduino recommends 17 AWG, which is not commonly available in the U.S.  
**Fix:** Verified 18 AWG stranded is electrically valid and suitable for bench wiring

**Issue:** Lack of visual standard across media documentation  
**Fix:** Created documentation protocol for image format, lighting, labeling, and repo structure

**Issue:** Hesitation around cutting wires for demo  
**Fix:** Resolved by affirming wiring log is part of curriculum integrity, not busywork

## Next Actions

- Cut and photograph Module 02 wiring per visual standard  
- Begin Module 03 wire length and DIN hookup  
- Begin `.md` documentation for Module 02 and 03 instructional pages  
- Add Arduino reference diagrams and callout overlays where needed  
- Ensure all visual media is referenced from within module folders and asset index

## Files / Commits / References

- Created:
    - `03_assets/Module02_Wiring_Log.md` (not yet committed)
- Planned:
    - `03_assets/Module02_DIN_Wiring.png` ← to be captured
    - `03_assets/Module02_Wiring_ArduinoRef.png`
- Commit: Pending media addition and folder pass
- Obsidian notes: 2025-07-25 — Media, wiring, visual standard draft

## Reflections / Notes

Most of today was not checkbox-driven. It was systems clarity.

This wasn’t about wiring one module — it was about setting a replicable visual and instructional standard for all future modules, students, and instructors. Once built and documented, these assets will become the baseline for both lab and instructional setups.

Visual coherence is not optional. It’s the part of the system that tells others, “This works — build it like this.”
