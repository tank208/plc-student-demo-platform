# DEVLOG – Week 5, Day 1

**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Time:** 10:00 – 13:00  
**Location:** Home PLC Lab  
**Time Logged:** 3.0 hours

## Context:

After completing initial ladder logic study on 05/30/25, I paused physical work due to travel and illness:

- 06/06–06/08: Traveled to Seattle for family graduation; no hands-on work, but reviewed ladder logic concepts
- 06/09–06/13: Returned home with fatigue and cold; needed full recovery time

## Focus:

- Reestablish project flow and reconnect with scope of modules
- Reviewed last saved work and project files, including `01_First_Steps.md`, ladder examples, and datasheets
- Recalibrated project direction and re-prioritized next tasks

## Reflection:

This pause created a sense of falling behind, but I recognize the value in long-haul pacing. My learning is not undone — just paused. Today was about remembering where I left off, and realigning with the scope of the research project. I am still the right person for this work.

## Next Step:

- Complete `02_Module` scaffold
- Begin safe power-up diagram with sensor input simulation
- Submit updated DEVLOG entries to GitHub
