# DEVLOG – Week 4, Day 1

**Date:** June 2, 2025
**Time:** 10:00  – 15:00
**Location:** Home PLC Lab  
**Time Logged:** 7.0

## Focus
- Deep dive into “A Bit of Theory” chapter of Arduino PLC training
- Cross-referenced textbook ladder logic with Arduino IDE ladder examples
- Clarified rung behavior, contact types (normally open/closed), and relay coil mapping

## Outcomes:

- Ladder logic now feels structurally intuitive, especially relay coil logic and control flow
- Able to mentally simulate rung activation based on power flow and input state
- Established baseline understanding for future module development (Module 02 forward)

## Teaching Consideration:

- Arduino’s implementation differs subtly from textbook industrial logic — important to note for students coming from pure theory or real-world systems
- Need to reinforce simulation thinking before hardware interaction
