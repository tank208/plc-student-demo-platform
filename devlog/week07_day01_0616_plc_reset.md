# DEVLOG – Week 7, Day 1

**Date:** June 16, 2025  
**Location:** Home PLC Lab  
**Time Logged:** 5.0 hours

## Focus

- Deep reading and annotation of _Programmable Logic Controllers – Sixth Edition_, Chapter 1
- Rebuilding mental continuity after two-week break due to travel and illness
- Reconnecting foundational PLC concepts to current research goals with the Arduino Opta platform

## Activities

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Programmable Logic Controllers

- Reviewed historical context of PLC development:
    - Originated to replace hardwired relay-based control systems
    - Designed for rugged industrial environments: temperature, vibration, EMI
- Identified core advantages of PLCs over relay systems:
    - Flexibility (reprogrammability)
    - Space savings
    - Diagnostic capabilities
    - Integration with SCADA and HMI systems
- Introduced types of control operations:
    - Discrete (on/off logic)
    - Analog (sensor-based control)
    - Sequential control (state machines)
    - Process control (timed/feedback loops)
- Differentiated PLCs from microcontrollers:
    - Emphasized industrial durability, deterministic scan cycles, and standardized logic models
- Briefly touched on:
    - Ladder Diagrams (LD)
    - Function Block Diagrams (FBD)
    - Scan cycle structure: input read → logic execution → output update

### Recovery Context

- This session marked the first full return to PLC study since June 1
- Reviewed notes from prior DEVLOGs to reconstruct mental map
- Reorganized Obsidian folder structure and re-read mission framing document to reaffirm goals

## Key Connections to Current Project

- PLCs were created specifically to protect industrial systems by replacing fragile, static relay banks
- My Arduino Opta work is an extension of that mission, adapted to modern prototyping and educational settings
- Scan cycle behavior, logic continuity, and real-world input/output mapping remain foundational across all platforms

## Reflection

Returning after time away required a deliberate reset. This was not a light reading day — it was a reconnection to the “why” behind the work. Chapter 1 reminded me that every rung I write, every input I wire, and every diagram I build is rooted in a long tradition of industrial control and protection. The PLC is not just a technical tool — it is an ethical boundary between chaos and control. My job is to understand it fully so I can defend that boundary.

## Next Steps

- Continue textbook study: Chapters 2 and 3
- Begin rebuilding technical velocity in DIN sensor deployment
- Resume DEVLOG routine daily to maintain momentum and reduce context-switching cost
