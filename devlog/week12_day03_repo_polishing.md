# DEVLOG – Week 12, Day 3

**Date:** 2025-07-24  
**Location:** Home PLC Lab  
**Time Logged:** 7 hours  
**System:** VS Code, Arduino PLC IDE, GitHub  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Commit ID:** _(pending final push)_

---

## Task Summary

**Planned:**

- Polish all code samples and ensure naming consistency
    
- Finalize and validate logic files for Modular Curriculum
    
- Write README for `02_code_samples/`
    
- Begin documentation pass for each module
    

**Actual:**

- Verified all `.st` files open cleanly and match module behavior
    
- Added standardized header comments to each code sample
    
- Cross-checked variable names to ensure they align with screenshots and curriculum
    
- Wrote a clear, instructional README for `02_code_samples/` folder
    
- Finalized best-effort ladder logic pseudocode for Module 01
    
- Confirmed `.txt` and `.st` coverage now exists for all modules
    

---

## System / Build Updates

- Each `.st` file now begins with a descriptive comment block identifying the module, author, and purpose
    
- Logic filenames now follow this format:
    
    - `01_First_Steps_ladder_logic.txt`
        
    - `02_Binary_Input_Counter.st`
        
    - `03_Celsius_Sensor_Control.st`
        
- Verified ladder logic pseudocode format is clear even if not functional in IDE
    
- `/02_code_samples/README.md` created with file descriptions, usage notes, and links to supporting folders
    

---

## Diagnostics and Testing

- Opened each `.st` file in the Arduino PLC IDE for syntax and structure confirmation
    
- Checked that ladder pseudocode reasonably reflects logic structure for instructional use
    
- All filenames and variable usage were confirmed to match screen captures and module references
    

---

## Key Findings and Learnings

- Naming consistency between code, screenshots, and documentation improves clarity and maintainability
    
- Ladder logic remains difficult to extract in functional form; pseudocode format is currently best option
    
- A standalone `README.md` for code samples is essential for instructors or reviewers to navigate logic quickly
    
- Adding headers to ST files improves their standalone usefulness when disconnected from the IDE
    

---

## Issues and Fixes

**Issue:** ST files had no context or authorship information  
**Fix:** Added descriptive headers with module title and brief logic summary

**Issue:** Ladder logic still not functional inside IDE  
**Fix:** Kept pseudocode version with clear naming and instructional intent; included in repo as `.txt`

**Issue:** No orientation for visitors to `02_code_samples/`  
**Fix:** Created new folder-level README to clarify usage, file format, and relationships to other materials

## Next Actions

- Begin formal documentation for each module:
    
    - Student + Instructor guides with code and asset links
        
- Populate `/03_assets/` with labeled screenshots:
    
    - Ladder logic
        
    - Oscilloscope captures
        
    - DIN wiring
        
- Draft `/docs/FINAL_REFLECTION.md` summarizing progress and insights
    
- Conduct a full repo pass to ensure all folders are internally referenced and navigable

## Files / Commits / References

- Files created or updated:
    
    - `02_code_samples/*.st` with headers
        
    - `02_code_samples/01_First_Steps_ladder_logic.txt`
        
    - `02_code_samples/README.md`
        
- Screenshots: Not yet added (next task)
    
- GitHub commit: Pending — staging for final folder checks
    
- Obsidian entry: 2025-07-24 notes reference logic validation and file polish

## Reflections / Notes

This was one of the most productive days of the entire project. I moved from exploratory work into final structuring. Each logic file is now cleaned, documented, and teachable. With the code archive formalized and named correctly, I now have a strong foundation to support the full set of modules.

This felt like architecture—everything is snapping into place.

**Note:**  
There was a 3-hour global outage of Starlink today, which temporarily disabled my internet access. I used this downtime to work fully offline, focusing on code cleanup, documentation structuring, and internal file consistency. The lack of network access actually helped me concentrate on polishing the code and curriculum materials without distraction.
