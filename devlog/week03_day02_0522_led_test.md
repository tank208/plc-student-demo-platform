# DEVLOG – Week 3, Day 3

**Date:** May 22, 2025  
**Time Logged:** 6.5 hours  
**Location:** UI CDA Robotics Lab

## Focus

- Execute Module 01 logic test using Arduino PLC IDE
- Validate runtime behavior with USB-only power
- Begin visual asset creation for student materials

## Actions Completed

- Flashed bootloader and activated runtime via Runtime Manager
- Resolved COM port reassignment (COM6 → COM8)
- Uploaded ladder program: `BTN_USER` input toggles `LED_BUILTIN`
- Verified logic execution in RUN mode using Live Debugger
- Captured signal state transitions (input/output)
- Updated documentation: runtime steps, variable mapping, and logic state verification

## Outcomes

- Module 01 functionality confirmed on hardware
- USB-only control path validated for internal logic
- Curriculum files to be updated with screenshots and walkthroughs

## Next Steps

- Add challenge variation (e.g., inverse logic, timer)
- Finalize `01_First_Steps.md` student-facing guide
- Build overview for Simul8 and Celsius components
