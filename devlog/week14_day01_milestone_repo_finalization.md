# DEVLOG – Week 14, Day 1

**Date:** 2025-08-04  
**Location:** Home PLC Lab  
**Time Logged:** 7 hours  
**System:** VS Code, Arduino PLC IDE, GitHub  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Commit ID:** `v2025.08.04` _(Milestone tag)_

---

## Task Summary

**Planned:**

- Finalize all curriculum modules (SG + TG)
    
- Complete README updates and version tagging
    
- Generate printable PDFs for instructor/faculty review
    
- Verify folder structure and documentation consistency
    

**Actual:**

- All modules (00–03) reviewed, finalized, and version tagged
    
- `TG` files updated with clear module purpose, wiring clarity, and assessment strategies
    
- README updated with August 4 milestone, educator-specific notes, and future directions
    
- Created `/printable_guides/` folder and added PDF versions of all SG and TG files
    
- Verified all internal links, folder consistency, and Markdown presentation
    
- Confirmed all files are sanitized and ready for review by faculty

## System / Build Updates

- `README.md` updated to reflect final beta version and curriculum alignment
    
- Milestone tag `v2025.08.04` added for curriculum beta
    
- All `.md` files validated and converted to PDF
    
- New folder structure:
    
    - `/printable_guides/Student/`
        
    - `/printable_guides/Instructor/`
        

---

## Diagnostics and Testing

- All code samples load and run successfully in Arduino PLC IDE
    
- Watch and Oscilloscope views tested for all sensor and relay behaviors
    
- Verified ST logic for smoothing (`Avg_Temp`) and hysteresis control works as intended
    
- Checked repo navigation and links across VS Code and GitHub preview

## Key Findings and Learnings

- Finalizing a modular curriculum requires equal focus on clarity, structure, and navigation
    
- Printable PDFs serve not just as backups, but as cross-platform delivery tools for educators
    
- Markdown is powerful for live editing, but professional formatting matters at faculty review stage
    
- Adding reflection and troubleshooting sections improves long-term student value and instructional reuse

## Issues and Fixes

**Issue:** No assets in `/docs/` despite folder being referenced  
**Fix:** Placeholder left for now; future reports (reflection, grant, planning) will populate it

**Issue:** TG files lacked consistent module purpose and clarity on learning outcomes  
**Fix:** Rewrote purpose blocks and learning alignment sections for all TGs

**Issue:** PDF conversion method unclear on Windows 11  
**Fix:** Used VS Code Markdown PDF plugin to batch convert via GUI; verified formatting

---

## Next Actions

- Begin drafting final faculty reflection for `/docs/`
    
- Plan Modbus TCP/IP SCADA integration phase (future module set)
    
- Meet with Mary Everett and/or John Shovic for beta curriculum review
    
- Begin modularization strategy for external adoption (grant or UI bootcamp)
    
- Finalize repository polish and submit milestone commit with changelog

## Reflections / Notes

This day marked the close of the first research phase. The curriculum is no longer theoretical — it is structured, teachable, and reproducible.

Today's work wasn’t just polish — it was the act of stepping out of the builder’s mindset and into the educator’s. The system now speaks for itself: clear logic, pre-wired modules, visual standards, and learning flows. Everything is ready for classroom or lab use.

This is the starting point, not the finish line. The real work begins when this system meets students.
