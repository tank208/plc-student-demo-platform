## Summary

Paused all work for approximately 2 weeks due to a serious medical emergency involving my son.  
He experienced a life-threatening allergic reaction to anesthesia following surgery, requiring emergency care and hospitalization.  

Family health and stability took priority, and I notified my research mentors accordingly.  
Now resuming all project responsibilities with full focus and energy.
