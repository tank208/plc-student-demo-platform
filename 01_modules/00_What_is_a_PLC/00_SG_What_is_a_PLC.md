## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Define what a PLC is and explain its core function
- Identify real-world applications of PLCs
- Understand why the Arduino Opta is used as a learning tool
- Explain the importance of PLCs in industrial automation and safety
- Describe how PLCs interact with sensors and actuators

## Setup Steps

1. **Intro Reading (10 min)**  
   Read “What is a PLC? Why Should You Care?” individually or as a class.

2. **Class Discussion (10–15 min)**  
   - Where have you seen automation in your life?
   - Why is real-time response critical for some systems?
   - What might happen if a PLC fails?

3. **Mini-Scenario Challenge (10 min)**  
   In small groups, pick a scenario (e.g., traffic light, water pump, furnace) and describe how a PLC would control it.

4. **Preview the Opta (5–10 min)**  
   Show the Arduino Opta, explain its inputs/outputs, and why it’s used for this course.

## Key Terms

- **PLC:** Programmable Logic Controller
- **Sensor:** A device that measures a physical quantity
- **Actuator:** A device that performs an action (motor, valve, etc.)
- **Logic Routine:** Set of conditions programmed to control outputs
- **Real-Time Control:** Processing and responding immediately as inputs change
