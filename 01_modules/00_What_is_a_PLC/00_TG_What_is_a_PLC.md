# Instructor Notes: Module 00 – What is a PLC?

---

## Objective

Introduce students to the purpose and importance of PLCs using relatable examples and light interaction. This sets the tone for the course and builds relevance before hands-on labs begin.

## Linked Resources

- [Student Guide: What is a PLC?](../01_curriculum/00_SG_What_is_a_PLC.md)
- [Arduino PLC Course – “What is a PLC?”](https://courses.arduino.cc/explore-plc/lessons/first-steps/)
- [Opta Hardware Overview](../03_assets/00_what_is_a_plc/00_opta-characteristics.jpg)

Make sure students have access to these materials during the lesson. The Arduino image can be displayed during the warm-up or demo.

## Materials Required

- Slides or handout of the article
- Whiteboard or projector
- Arduino Opta demo unit (optional but helpful)

---

## Pre-Class Setup

- Print or distribute digital copy of the “What is a PLC?” document
- Set up projector or display to show key diagrams (e.g., Opta photo, sensor examples)

---

## Suggested Flow

1. **Warm-Up Discussion** (5 min)
   - “What runs traffic lights? Elevators? Amusement rides?”
   - Students brainstorm what might control those systems

2. **Read-Aloud or Silent Reading** (10 min)
   - Article walkthrough
   - Highlight bolded terms and answer quick Qs as needed

3. **Group Challenge** (10 min)
   - Assign or let groups choose a real-world PLC task
   - Have them describe inputs, logic, and outputs

4. **Show and Tell** (5 min)
   - Display the Opta hardware
   - Emphasize it’s a real industrial controller, not a toy

## Key Teaching Points

- PLCs are rugged, real-time computers
- They are everywhere — in systems students depend on daily
- The Arduino Opta is industry-grade but classroom safe
- The “logic” part is what students will learn to write
