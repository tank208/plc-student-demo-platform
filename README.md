# Arduino Opta PLC Student Training Platform

This project develops a modular, reproducible PLC training system using the Arduino Opta WiFi. It's designed to introduce high school and early-college students to the fundamentals of industrial automation, ladder logic programming, and secure control system design.

The repository includes:
- Beginner-friendly curriculum modules with scaffolded learning progression
- Instructor guides with safety notes, wiring considerations, and live demo strategies
- Development logs documenting progress, rationale, and design decisions
- Safe programming workflow using USB-only power for initial modules
