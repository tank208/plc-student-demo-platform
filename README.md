# PLC Student Demo Platform

This repository supports the development and deployment of a reproducible, secure industrial control system training module using the Arduino Opta micro-PLC and Ignition SCADA software.

## Project Purpose

The project introduces students (high school through college) to:
- PLC hardware (Arduino Opta)
- Ladder Logic programming via Arduino PLC IDE
- Modbus TCP/IP communication
- SCADA visualization with Ignition
- Secure OT system design principles

## Folder Structure

- `00_intro/`: Context, purpose, student-facing intro material
- `01_curriculum/`: Workshop modules, student worksheets, slides
- `02_instructor/`: Wiring guides, instructor setup notes, demos
- `03_code/`: PLC code (IEC 61131-3) and Arduino sketches
- `04_assets/`: Diagrams, photos, instructional screenshots
- `devlog/`: Daily technical logs, sanitized for public use
- `docs/`: Research proposal, project plan, datasheets

## Status

- Week 3 in development
- LED/Button module proof of concept complete
- Curriculum scaffolding under active development

## Contributors

- Student Research Lead: William Hall (UI CDA Lab)
- Advisors: Dr. John Shovic, Dr. Mary Everett

## Notes

This repository is sanitized for public educational use. Full hardware schematics and instructor wiring plans are kept private in instructional archives.
