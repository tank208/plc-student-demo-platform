# Project Overview – PLC Student Demo Platform

This project delivers a modular, classroom-ready PLC training platform using the Arduino Opta and DIN Simul8.

## Audience

- High school students
- Undergraduate students in cybersecurity, systems, or industrial tech
- Instructors teaching basic PLC concepts

## Modules Included

| Module | Title                          | Focus                           |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 00     | What is a PLC?                 | Conceptual introduction          |
| 01     | First Steps with Arduino Opta  | Basic relay output / toggling    |
| 02     | Binary Input Counter           | Digital input and rising edge    |
| 03     | Celsius Temperature Control    | Analog input and relay control   |

## What This Repo Includes

- Fully documented curriculum modules (student + instructor versions)
- Extracted Structured Text and Ladder Logic examples
- Hardware wiring guides and images
- Visual assets for debugging and teaching
- DEVLOG tracking progress, bugs, and engineering decisions

## How to Use

1. Read through `/01_modules/` starting with Module 00
2. Review code in `/02_code_samples/`
3. Follow wiring guides and photos in `/03_assets/`
4. Teach from the student version, and reference instructor notes as needed

This project was developed by William Hall for the University of Idaho – Coeur d’Alene under the guidance of Dr. John Shovic and Dr. Mary Everett.
