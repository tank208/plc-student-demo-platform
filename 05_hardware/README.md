# DIN Rail Test Stand – Hardware Documentation

This folder contains the STL and Bambu Studio 3MF project files for a 3D-printable base that securely mounts DIN rail hardware and terminal blocks. It was designed as part of the Arduino Opta PLC curriculum to protect lab equipment and enable safe, repeatable classroom use.

## File Contents

- `din_rail_test_stand.stl` – STL file for 3D printing
- `din_rail_test_stand.3mf` – Bambu Studio file with layout and print profile
- `part_list.md` – Materials and hardware required for test bed assembly
- `print_instructions.md` – Slicer settings and print guidance
- `din_rail_stand.png` - 3D render of part
